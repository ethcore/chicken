# Chicken contract

Actually a set of contracts, but contract.sol is the main one. Very simple multiplayer game. Anyone can place any amount of money in the contract; the first half of the money taken out comes out at a 10% loss; the second half at a 10% profit.

### Quick start

Ensure you're running on the testnet. Ensure index.html doesn't have the line setting the defaultAccount to the 0x0037... address. Navigate to the index.html. Play.

### Deploying it

Deploy to your network using your favourite means of deployment. Ensure you alter the 0xf56a... address in the contract to the newly deployed contract address. Do as above.
